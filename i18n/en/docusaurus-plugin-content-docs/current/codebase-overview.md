## How to develop

### Environment Preparation

:::note
Need to make sure your Node.js version is greater than `8` (it is recommended to install `10.5` or higher)
:::

First fork a copy of the Taro repository to your Github, then clone the project locally and switch to the `next` branch.

Then run the following commands in sequence.

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn run bootstrap
$ yarn build
```

After running the above command, the environment is ready and you can pull a new branch for development.

### Code Style

* `JavaScript`：Follow [JavaScript Standard Style](https://github.com/standard/standard)，For details, see the root directory `.eslintrc.js`。
* `TypeScript`: Follow variants based on [JavaScript Standard Style](https://github.com/standard/standard), see `.eslintrc.js` in the root directory and `tsconfig.json` in the relevant package directory for details.
* Styles: follow the `.stylelintrc` style in the relevant package directory.

### Debug

During debugging, the [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-link/) command is typically used to softlink the package to be debugged to a test project.

To debug **compile-time** code, please refer to ["Single-step debugging"](./debug-config).

Debug **Runtime** code, you can breakpoint debug directly.

### Unit tests

The packages are currently equipped with unit tests for.

- `babel-preset-taro`
- `@tarojs/cli`
- `@tarojs/components`
- `@tarojs/react`
- `@tarojs/webpack-runner`
- `@tarojs/mini-runner`
- `@tarojs/runtime`
- `@tarojs/taro-rn`
- `@tarojs/components-rn`

After modifying the above packages, developers should make sure to run `lerna run test:ci --scope [package name]` to check if the test cases all pass.

Also, after developing some important features, please take time to fill in the corresponding test cases.

:::note
Note: `@tarojs/mini-runner` and `@tarojs/webpack-runner` use `snapshot` (snapshot of test results), and modifying these two packages or some other packages may cause these snapshots to fail, and thus fail the tests. When you modify these two packages, or if CI prompts you with a test case error for these two packages, run `lerna run updateSnapshot --scope [package name]` to update the snapshot and resubmit.
