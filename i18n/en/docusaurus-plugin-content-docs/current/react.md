title: React
---

Taro supports development with React, but it is slightly different from using React in the browser, in the following ways: 

## Entry Component

Every Taro application needs an entry component to register the application. The default entry file is `app.js` in the `src` directory.

To use React in Taro, the entry component must export a React component. In the entry component we can set the global state or access the lifecycle of the mini-program entry instance

```jsx title="app.js"
import React, { Component } from 'react'

// If we use the Redux
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import configStore from './store'

// Global Style
import './app.css'

const store = configStore()

class App extends Component {
  // All React component methods can be used
  componentDidMount () {}

  // onLaunch
  onLaunch () {}

  //  onShow
  componentDidShow () {}

  //  onHide
  componentDidHide () {}

  render () {
    // Nothing will be rendered in the entry component, but we can do something like state management here
    return (
      <Provider store={store}>
        /* this.props.children is the page that will be rendered */
        {this.props.children}
      </Provider>
    )
  }
}

export default App
```

### onLaunch (options)

> `onLaunch` of the corresponding app in the mini-program.

Program initialization parameters can be accessed during this lifecycle by accessing the `options` parameter or by calling `getCurrentInstance().router`.

#### Parameters

##### options

| Proerty | Type |  Description |
| - | - | - |
| path | string | Path for launch mini-program |
| scene | number | Scene values for launch mini-program |
| query | Object | Parameters for launch mini-program |
| shareTicket | string | shareTicket，See Get More Forwarding Information |
| referrerInfo | Object | Source information. Source information. Returned when accessing an mini-program from another mini-program, public number or app. Otherwise returns {} |


##### options.referrerInfo

| Proerty | Type |  Description |
| - | - | - |
| appId | string | Source mini-program, or public number (in WeChat)） |
| extraData | Object | The data passed from the source mini-program is supported by WeChat and Baidu smart-program at scene=1037 or 1038  |
| sourceServiceId | string | Source plugin, visible when in plugin run mode |

>  The options parameter may vary from field to field in different mini-program
>
> Scenario values , there are differences in WeChat Mini-program and Baidu Smart-program, please refer to them respectively  [Wechat Mini-program](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/dev/framework/app-service/scene.html) 和 [Baidu Smart-program Documents](https://smartprogram.baidu.com/docs/data/scene/)

### componentDidShow (options)

Triggered when the program is started, or foregrounded.

As with the `onLaunch` lifecycle, program initialization parameters can be accessed during this lifecycle by accessing the `options` parameter or calling `getCurrentInstance().router`.

The parameters are basically the same as those obtained in `onLaunch`, but with two additional parameters in **Baidu Smart-program** as follows.

| Proerty | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| entryType | string | Source identifier, take the value of user/ schema /sys :<br />user：Indicates before and after passing home<br/>Switching or unlocking the screen, etc. to bring up.<br/>schema：Indicates a protocol call-up;<br />sys：Other |
| appURL | string | The call-up protocol at the time of the presentation, which exists only if the value of entryType is schema |

### componentDidHide ()

Triggered when the program switches to the background.

### onPageNotFound (Object)

Triggered when the page to be opened by the program does not exist.

#### Parameters
##### Object

| Proerty | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| path | string | Path to non-existent page |
| query | Object | Open the query parameter of a non-existent page |
| isEntryPage | boolean | Whether it is the first page of this launch |


## Page Components

Every Taro application includes at least one page component, which can jump through Taro routes and also access the lifecycle of the mini-program page.

```jsx title="Class Component"
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { View } from '@tarojs/components'

class Index extends Component {
  // All React component methods can be used
  componentDidMount () {}

  // onLoad
  onLoad () {}

  // onReady
  onReady () {}

  // onShow
  componentDidShow () {}

  // onHide
  componentDidHide () {}

  // onPullDownRefresh，except for componentDidShow/componentDidHide 
  // All page lifecycle function names correspond to mini-program
  onPullDownRefresh () {}

  render () {
    return (
      <View className='index' />
    )
  }
}

export default Index
```

```jsx title="Functional Component"
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { View } from '@tarojs/components'
import {
  useReady,
  useDidShow,
  useDidHide,
  usePullDownRefresh
} from '@tarojs/taro'

function Index () {
  // All React Hooks can be used
  useEffect(() => {})

  // onReady
  useReady(() => {})

  // onShow
  useDidShow(() => {})

  // onHide
  useDidHide(() => {})

  // Taro implements custom React Hooks for all mini-program page lifecycles to support
  usePullDownRefresh(() => {})

  return (
    <View className='index' />
  )
}

export default Index
```

### Routing parameters

In the page component, the routing parameters for the current page can be obtained via `getCurrentInstance().router`.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { View } from '@tarojs/components'

class Index extends Component {
  // It is recommended that the result of getCurrentInstance() be saved for later use when the page is initialized.
  //  instead of calling this API frequently
  $instance = getCurrentInstance()

  componentDidMount () {
    // Get router parameters
    console.log($instance.router)
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <View className='index' />
    )
  }
}

export default Index
```

### Lifecycle Trigger

Taro 3 implements a web-standard BOM and DOM API on the mini-program logic layer. So the `document.appendChild`, `document.removeChild`, and other APIs used by React are actually implemented by Taro emulation, with the end effect of rendering React's virtual DOM tree as a Web-standard DOM tree emulated by Taro.

So in Taro3, React's lifecycle trigger timing is a little different from what we normally understand in web development.

#### React lifecycle

The lifecycle methods of React components are supported in Taro.

Trigger timing：

##### 1. componentWillMount ()

After [onLoad](./react#onload-options), the page component is triggered before rendering to Taro's virtual DOM.

##### 2. componentDidMount ()

Triggered after the page component is rendered to Taro's virtual DOM.

Taro's virtual DOM is accessible at this point (using methods such as React ref, document.getElementById, etc.), and modifications to it are supported (setting the style of the DOM, etc.).

However, this does not mean that Taro's virtual DOM data has been transferred from the logical layer `setData` to the view layer. So at this point ** it is not possible to get the DOM nodes of the rendering layer of the mini program by methods like `createSelectorQuery`. ** You can only get the DOM node in [onReady](./react#onready-) lifecycle.


#### Methods for mini-program pages

The methods in the mini-program page can also be used in Taro's page: write the methods with the same name in the Class Component and use the corresponding Hooks in the Functional Component.

**Attention:**

*  Mini-program page methods also differ across platforms
*  Mini-program page components that use HOC wrappers must handle forwardRef or use inherited components instead of returned components, otherwise the mini program page method may not be triggered.

### onLoad (options)

> `onLoad` of the corresponding page in the mini-program.

Page routing parameters can be accessed during this lifecycle by accessing the `options` parameter or by calling `getCurrentInstance().router`.

### onReady ()

> `onReady` of the corresponding page in the mini-program.

This lifecycle begins with access to the DOM nodes of the mini-program rendering layer using APIs such as `createCanvasContext` or `createSelectorQuery`.

#### The onReady of the child component

The `onReady` lifecycle is only triggered for page components.
Child components can use Taro's built-in [Message System](./apis/about/events) to listen to the `onReady()` lifecycle of the page component.


```jsx title="A child component in a page"
import React from 'react'
import { View } from '@tarojs/components'
import Taro, { eventCenter, getCurrentInstance } from '@tarojs/taro'

class Test extends React.Component {
  $instance = getCurrentInstance()

  componentWillMount () {
    const onReadyEventId = this.$instance.router.onReady
    eventCenter.once(onReadyEventId, () => {
      console.log('onReady')

      Taro.createSelectorQuery().select('#only')
        .boundingClientRect()
        .exec(res => console.log(res, 'res'))
    })
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <View id="only">
      </View>
    )
  }
}
```

But when the child component is **load-on-demand**, the page `onReady` has already been triggered. If this on-demand subcomponent needs to get the DOM node of the rendering layer of the mini program because it missed the page `onReady`, it can only try to simulate it using `Taro.nextTick`.


```jsx title="Load-on-demand subcomponents"
import React from 'react'
import { View } from '@tarojs/components'
import Taro from '@tarojs/taro'

class Test extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount () {
    Taro.nextTick(() => {
      // Use Taro.nextTick to simulate that setData has ended and the node has finished rendering
      Taro.createSelectorQuery().select('#only')
        .boundingClientRect()
        .exec(res => console.log(res, 'res'))
    })
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <View id="only" />
    )
  }
}
```

### componentDidShow ()

> `onShow` of the corresponding page in the mini-program.

Triggered when the page is displayed/entered in the foreground.

#### The onShow of the Subcomponents

The `onShow` lifecycle is only triggered for page components.
Subcomponents can use Taro's built-in [message system](./apis/about/events) to listen to the `onShow()` lifecycle of the page component.


```jsx title="A sub-component of the page"
import React from 'react'
import { View } from '@tarojs/components'
import { eventCenter, getCurrentInstance } from '@tarojs/taro'

class Test extends React.Component {
  $instance = getCurrentInstance()

  componentWillMount () {
    const onShowEventId = this.$instance.router.onShow
    eventCenter.on(onShowEventId, this.onShow)
  }

  componentWillUnmount () {
    const onShowEventId = this.$instance.router.onShow
    eventCenter.off(onShowEventId, this.onShow)
  }

  onShow = () => {
    console.log('onShow')
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <View id="only" />
    )
  }
}
```

### componentDidHide ()

> `onHide` of the corresponding page in the mini-program.

Triggered when the page is hidden/entered in the background.

#### The onHide of a subcomponent

The `onHide` lifecycle is only triggered for page components.
Subcomponents can use Taro's built-in [message system](./apis/about/events) to listen to the `onHide()` lifecycle of the page component.

```jsx title="A sub-component of the page"
import React from 'react'
import { View } from '@tarojs/components'
import { eventCenter, getCurrentInstance } from '@tarojs/taro'

class Test extends React.Component {
  $instance = getCurrentInstance()

  componentWillMount () {
    const onHideEventId = this.$instance.router.onHide
    eventCenter.on(onHideEventId, this.onHide)
  }

  componentWillUnmount () {
    const onHideEventId = this.$instance.router.onHide
    eventCenter.off(onHideEventId, this.onHide)
  }

  onHide = () => {
    console.log('onHide')
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <View id="only" />
    )
  }
}
```

### onPullDownRefresh ()

Listen to the user drop-down action.

- You need to set it in the window option of the global configuration or in the page configuration
`enablePullDownRefresh: true`.
- The pull-down refresh can be triggered by [Taro.startPullDownRefresh](./apis/ui/pull-down-refresh/startPullDownRefresh.md), which triggers the pull-down refresh animation after the call, and the effect is the same as the user's manual pull-down refresh.
- When the data has been processed and refreshed, [Taro.stopPullDownRefresh](./apis/ui/pull-down-refresh/stopPullDownRefresh.md) You can stop the drop-down refresh of the current page.

### onReachBottom ()

Listen to the user pull-up bottoming event.


- The trigger distance can be set in the window option of the global configuration or in the page configuration  `onReachBottomDistance`。
- This event will only be triggered once during the slide within the trigger distance

## Built-in components

Taro is developed using built-in components of the mini-program specification, such as `<View />`, `<Text />`, `<Button />`, etc.

Before using these built-in components in React, they must be brought in from `@tarojs/components` and the component props follow the **Upper camelcase naming convention**.

Mini-program writing method:

```html
<view hover-class='test' />
```

Taro writing method:

```jsx
import { View } from '@tarojs/components'

<View hoverClass='test' />
```

## Events

Events in Taro follow the  lower camelcase naming convention, with all built-in event names starting with `on`.

In the event callback function, the first argument is the event itself, and calling `stopPropagation` in the callback will stop the bubbling.

```jsx
function Comp () {
  function clickHandler (e) {
    e.stopPropagation()
  }

  function scrollHandler () {}
  
  // The mini-program bindtap corresponds to Taro's onClick
  // The rest of the mini-program event names replace bind with on, which is the name of the Taro event (except for the Alipay mini-program, whose event starts with on)
  return <ScrollView onClick={clickHandler} onScroll={scrollHandler} />
}
```

### Taro 3 event system on the mini-program

In Taro 1 & 2, Taro determines whether the events bound in the mini program template are in the form of `bind` or `catch` depending on whether the developer uses `e.stopPropagation()`. Thus event bubbling is controlled by the mini-program.

But in Taro 3, we have implemented a system of events in the mini-program logic layer, including event triggering and event bubbling. The events bound in the mini-program template are in the form of `bind`.

In general, this system of mini-program events implemented in the logic layer works properly, with event callbacks that trigger, bubble, and stop bubbling correctly.

However, the `catchtouchmove` event bound to the mini-program template prevents the callback function from bubbling through** in addition to preventing the view from **scrolling through**, something Taro's event system cannot do.

### Block rolling penetration

In the previous point, we introduced the event mechanism of Taro 3. Since events are bound as `bind`, you cannot use `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent scroll-through.

Two solutions are summarized for the problem of rolling penetration:

#### 一、Style

Use the style to solve. [Disable scrolling of penetrated components](https://github.com/NervJS/taro/issues/5984#issuecomment-614502302)。

This is also the most recommended practice.

#### 二、CatchMove

> Supported by Taro 3.0.21 and above

But the map component itself is scrollable, even if its width and height are fixed. So the first approach can't handle the scrolling events that bubble up to the map component.

This is the time to add the **catchMove** property to the `View` component.

```jsx
// This View component will bind the catchtouchmove event instead of bindtouchmove.
<View catchMove></View>
```

## Global Variables

When using React, global variables are recommended to be managed using a state management tool such as **React Redux**.

And sometimes some projects converting from native mini-program mount global variables to `app` and use `getApp()` to get them. Converting to the React ecosystem's way of managing state is more costly.

Therefore, you can use the `taroGlobalData` property of the entry object for compatibility with this writing style.

```jsx title="app.js"
class App extends Component {
  taroGlobalData = {
    x: 1
  }
  render () {
    return this.props.children
  }
}
```

```jsx title="index.js"
function Index () {
  const app = Taro.getApp()
  console.log(app.x)

  return (...)
}
```

## Hooks

[Hooks Document](./hooks.md)

## Other limitations

* Since mini-program do not support dynamic introduction, the `React.lazy` API cannot be used in mini-program.
* It is not possible to insert elements outside the DOM tree of a page component, so `<Portal>` is not supported.
* The `id` of all components must remain unique throughout the application (even if they are on different pages), otherwise it may cause problems with events not firing.[#7317](https://github.com/NervJS/taro/issues/7317)

## Frequently Asked Questions

* The render layer element information is not available in `useEffect`, `componentDidMount`.[7116](https://github.com/NervJS/taro/issues/7116)
* The latest width and height of the component is not available in `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect`.[#7491](https://github.com/NervJS/taro/issues/7491)
* When the nesting level is deep, the child elements cannot be queried using `selectorQuery`.[#7411](https://github.com/NervJS/taro/issues/7411)
