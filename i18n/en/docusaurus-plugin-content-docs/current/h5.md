This article will introduce H5 development related content, including compatibility, considerations, etc.

## Compatibility

### ES5

By default, the `target` of `@babel/preset-env` is configured as follows

```js
targets = {
  ios: '9',
  android: '5'
}
```

If you need to be compatible with lower versions of the system, change the configuration of `babel-preset-taro` in `babel.config.js` in the project root directory. (The parameters exposed by `babel-preset-taro` are not documented at the moment, please refer to [source](https://github.com/NervJS/taro/blob/next/packages/babel-preset-taro/index.js) for detailed configuration, welcome to contribute documentation ~)

#### babel-loader

To improve compilation speed, Taro sets the `external` attribute to `babel-loader`. Dependencies in `node_modules` (except for those named with `taro`) are not compiled by babel. See [Github](https://github.com/NervJS/taro/blob/4aa08d541b1c5221bf420fc0f4a305960e22aa0a/packages/taro-webpack-runner/src/util/chain.ts#L502-L510) for the `babel-loader` configuration.

Therefore the following issues need to be noted.

* `@tarojs/components` is not compiled by Babel by default, but ES5 packages were not compiled before `3.2.10`, please update to `3.2.10` and above.
* Dependencies in `node_modules` are not compiled by default, if you have compatibility needs, please modify the `external` property of `babel-loader` manually using [WebpackChain](config-detail#h5webpackchain).

#### Android 4.4

Android 4.4 compatible Please make sure you have done the following.

* Taro is using `v3.2.15+` version.
* Use the compatibility component library (only React is supported for now).
* Properly configure `babel-preset-taro` and install `corejs3`.
* If you still have problems with `Promise undefined`, you can manually introduce a Promise polyfill in `index.html`.

### React compatibility component library

:::note
Taro 3.2.4 started to support
:::

Taro3 H5-side component library is based on `Web Components` and was developed using the [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) framework.

> Stencil [Compatibility Status](https://stenciljs.com/docs/browser-support)

However, there are still some problems with mobile support for `Web Components`, the main issues are as follows.

* Android 4.4 white screen
* Multi-line text truncation failure
* Some Android machines (OPPO, VIVO mostly), the style `visibility` switch fails to cause the page white screen

Therefore, developers with strong compatibility requirements can use the **React Compatibility Component Library** instead of the default `Web Components` component library. It is completely based on React and has good compatibility, but currently **only a few commonly used components** have been adapted, so developers should **choose carefully** to use it.

#### Usage

1. Installing the Compatibility Component Library

```bash
$ yarn add @tarojs/components-react
```

2. Set the compilation configuration `h5.useHtmlComponents`

```js title="config/index.js"
module.exports = {
  h5: {
    useHtmlComponents: true
  }
}
```

3. Start Compile

```bash
$ taro build --type h5 --watch
```

#### 贡献流程

Due to manpower issues, the Taro team is still focusing on the `Web Components` component library for iteration. Developers are also welcome to add to the React-compatible component library by converting components developed in `Stencil` syntax to React syntax (Stencil supports JSX, so it's not a lot of work). See the development process at [@tarojs/component-react](https://github.com/NervJS/taro/blob/next/packages/taro-components-react/README.md#%E6%94%B9%E9%80%A0%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95)

## React 

Some issues to keep in mind when developing H5 with React.

### fast refresh

React has the [fast refresh](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16604#issuecomment-528663101) feature enabled by default in H5 Dev compile mode.

However, when [custom environment variable](https://github.com/NervJS/taro/issues/9576) is used, the following error is reported.

![](https://storage.360buyimg.com/cjj-pub-images/fast-refresh-error.png)

or when `Webpack devServer` is configured to turn off hot updates: `hot: false`, the following error will be reported.

:::danger
Uncaught ReferenceError: $RefreshSig$ is not defined
:::

This is all because in dev environments, Taro does two things by default.

- Use the Babel plugin with `fast-refresh`
- Setting `devServer.hot` in the Webpack configuration to true will add the `fast refresh` loader.

And the `fast refresh` Babel plugin and the loader must be enabled or disabled at the same time.

So when you get the above error, or if you don't want to enable `fast refresh`, you can disable it by configuring both Babel and Webpack.

```js title="config/index.js" {5}
const config = {
  // ...
  h5: {
    devServer: {
      hot: false
    }
  }
}
```

```js title="babel.config.js" {5}
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    ['taro', {
      framework: 'react',
      hot: false
    }]
  ]
}
```
