title: Migrated from native mini program?

This article will talk about the main differences between Taro development and native mini program development. I hope it will help students who master native mini program development but don't know much about Taro to migrate quickly.

## Global Variables

When using React/Vue, global variables are recommended to be managed with state management tools like **React Redux**, **Vuex**.

And sometimes some projects converted from native  mini program will mount global variables to `app` and use `getApp()` to get them. It is more expensive to convert to **React Redux**, **Vuex** and other state management methods.

This writing style can therefore be made compatible using the `taroGlobalData` property of the entry object.

```jsx title="app.js"
class App extends Component {
  taroGlobalData = {
    x: 1
  }
  render () {
    return this.props.children
  }
}
```

```jsx title="index.js"
function Index () {
  const app = Taro.getApp()
  console.log(app.x)

  return (...)
}
```

## API Scope

In native mini program development, when calling some APIs in custom components, such as `createCanvasContext`, `createSelectorQuery`, etc., you need to pass in `this` that points to the custom component itself, which is tentatively called `scope`.

However, Taro 3 uses the `<template>` tag for rendering and does not normally use custom components, so you don't need to pass it in.

There are only two cases where a custom component will be used, and you need to pass `scope` correctly, otherwise such API calls will fail.


### 1. Hierarchy Too Deep

For mini program without recursion support (platform-plugin-template#recursive vs. non-recursive template) (WeChat, QQ, Jingdong mini program, etc.), when the page element nesting level exceeds a certain number of levels (default is 16, which can be modified by configuring [baseLevel](config-detail#minibaselevel)), a custom component will be created to assist recursion.

The `scope` of this custom component is not exposed to the developer, so it needs to be wrapped with a `<CustomWrapper>` component if the hierarchy is too deep and you need to call this API.

### 2. Use `<CustomWrapper>`

[`<CustomWrapper>`](optimized#2-customwrapper-component) It is often used to optimize update performance. It is essentially an mini program custom component.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="React"
  values={[
    {label:  <ReactIcon />, value: 'React'},
    {label: <VueIcon />, value: 'Vue'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="React">

```jsx title="Sample Code"
<CustomWrapper id='demo' />

const page = Taro.getCurrentInstance().page
// Get the CustomWrapper custom component object, which is also known as scope
const scope = page.selectComponent('#demo')
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Vue">

```html title="Sample Code"
<template>
  <custom-wrapper id="demo" />
</template>

<script>
import Taro from '@tarojs/taro'

export default {
  onReady () {
    const page = Taro.getCurrentInstance().page
    // Get the CustomWrapper custom component object, which is also known as scope
    const scope = page.selectComponent('#demo')
  }
}
</script>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## dataset

The `dataset` concept for mini program is partially implemented in Taro, for details see.

- [React dataset](react-overall#dataset)
- [Vue dataset](vue-overall#dataset)
