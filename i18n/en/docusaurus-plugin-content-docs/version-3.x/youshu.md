## Existing mini programs access Tencent Youshu SDK

### 1. Installation

  * Install SDK via npm `npm i sr-sdk-wxapp`
  * Introduce the SDK via import in app.jsx `import sr from 'sr-sdk-wxapp'`

### 2. Add Trusted Domain

Login to [WeChat Public Platform](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/), go to `<Development> <Development Settings> <Server Domain>`, add `https://zhls.qq.com` as request legal domain.


> There is also SDK version checking in the development environment, so it will prompt `https://sr-home-1257214331.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com is not in the list of legal domains for the following request` , which can be handled by setting not to check the domain name.

### 3. Initialize

`init(options: object)`

Configuration interface to adjust the base settings of the SDK. Should be called before the `App()` call.

The first call initializes the SDK, and the second call overwrites the previously passed configuration, which can be called multiple times.
