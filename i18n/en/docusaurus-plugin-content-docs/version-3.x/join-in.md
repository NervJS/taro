[Taro](https://taro.jd.com), as a unified development solution, has been growing rapidly since its birth. From a single development framework to a multi-tier solution serving tens of thousands of developers today, Taro's growth is due to the efforts of the Taro team, but more importantly, the support and help from the community.

## What is open source facing

We can start by looking at a set of data.

Taro has **5227** commits, **235** releases, **3908** issues opened, **3296** closed thanks to the efforts of the Taro team and community, and nearly **600** issues to be resolved. Taro is also opening around **50** new issues every week, and has collected **709** PRs, adding up to **656**.

In addition, the number of posts on the [Taro Community](https://taro-club.jd.com/) has reached **3000** and is increasing at a rate of **200** per week, while the [Taro Official Documentation](https://docs.taro.zone/), a must-have resource for Taro beginners and developers, has reached **20w** per week.

At the same time, Taro also has **20+** developer exchange WeChat groups of **500** people, and 10+ seminar groups with the official teams of various small programs and R&D teams of major companies, so the developers of Taro team are bombarded with massive information every day.

From this, we can see that Taro now has a large and active developer community, which generates a lot of information, either questions, suggestions, code submissions or useful wheels every day. As the community becomes bigger and bigger, the question of how to manage it effectively and improve the overall experience of using the community becomes a problem for the Taro team, and there is an urgent need to find a balance between solution iteration and community maintenance so that Taro can go farther and grow better.

## The power from the community

As the saying goes, "A single thread does not make a thread, and a single tree does not make a forest".

Taro is no longer a single-team project, but a joint project of the entire Taro development community. The [members](https://github.com/orgs/NervJS/people) of the NervJS organization to which Taro belongs have also added R&D staff from other companies like Huawei and Tencent to the project, and the community has **230** contributors.

For now Taro has surpassed one mountain of development, but he is on his way to even higher peaks.
