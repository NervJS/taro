title: Entry Component
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'
import { VueIcon, ReactIcon } from './guides/index'

Every Taro application needs an entry component (Vue component) to register the application. The portal file is by default `app.js` in the `src` directory.

In the entry component we can set the global state or access the lifecycle of the mini program entry instance.

#### Note:

1. Since Taro v3.1, the Vue2 entry component has been written with **Breaking Changes**, see [3.1.0 Release Information](https://github.com/NervJS/taro/releases/tag/v3.1.0) for details.
2. Due to a change in the Vue3 Global API ([0009-global-api-change](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/blob/master/active-rfcs/0009-global-api-change.md)), the Vue3's entry component is written differently than Vue2.

## Example Code

<Tabs
  defaultValue="vue"
  values={[
    {label: 'Vue2', value: 'vue'},
    {label: 'Vue3', value: 'vue3'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="vue">

```js title="app.js"
import Vue from 'vue'
// Assuming we have configured the vuex in '. /store' is configured with vuex
import store from './store'

const App = {
  store,

  // All Vue lifecycle methods can be used
  mounted () {},

  // Corresponds to onLaunch
  onLaunch () {},

  // Corresponds to onShow
  onShow (options) {},

  // Corresponds to onHide
  onHide () {},

  render(h) {
    // this.$slots.default is the page that will be rendered
    return h('block', this.$slots.default)
  }
}

export default App
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="vue3">

```jsx  title="app.js"
import { createApp } from 'vue'

const app = createApp({
  // All Vue lifecycle methods can be used
  mounted () {},

  // Corresponds to onLaunch
  onLaunch () {},

  // Corresponds to onShow
  onShow (options) {},

  // Corresponds to onHide
  onHide () {},

 // The entry component does not need to implement the render method, and even if it does, it will be overridden by taro
 })

export app
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Entry Component Configuration

Please refer to the [global configuration](./app-config)

## Lifecycle

> In Vue2 and Vue3, the additional lifecycle methods added by Taro are written in the same way

In addition to supporting Vue's lifecycle methods, the entry component additionally supports the following lifecycles according to the applet's standards.

### onLaunch (options)

> `onLaunch` for the corresponding app in the mini program environment.

The program initialization parameters are accessible through `getCurrentInstance().router.params` during this lifecycle

#### Parameters

##### options

| - | - | - |
| path | string | Path for launch mini program |
| scene | number | Scene values for launch mini program |
| query | Object | Parameters for launch mini program |
| shareTicket | string | shareTicket，See Get More Forwarding Information |
| referrerInfo | Object | Source information. Source information. Returned when accessing an mini program from another mini program, public number or app. Otherwise returns {} |

>
> Scene values , there are differences in WeChat mini program and Baidu smart program, please refer to them respectively  [Wechat mini program](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/dev/framework/app-service/scene.html) 和 [Baidu smart program Documents](https://smartprogram.baidu.com/docs/data/scene/)

### onShow (options)

Triggered when the page is displayed/cut to the foreground

As with the `onLaunch` lifecycle, program initialization parameters can be accessed during this lifecycle by accessing the `options` parameter or calling `getCurrentInstance().router`.

The parameters are basically the same as those obtained in `onLaunch`, but with two additional parameters in **Baidu Smart program** as follows.
