title: Message to developer
---

> 2019.10.29

[Taro](https://taro.jd.com) As a multi-sided development solution, has been evolving at a high speed since its inception, from a single development framework to a multi-sided solution that now serves tens of thousands of developers. Taro has grown up with the efforts of the Taro team, but more importantly, with the support and help of a broad community of developers.

## What Open Source Faces

We can first look at a set of data.

Taro has a total of **5227** commits, released **235** versions, while **3908** issues have been turned on, thanks to the efforts of the Taro team and community, Close **3296** and close to **600** issues to be resolved, while the new issues opened by Taro are also on **50** or lower; Also harvested **709** PRs, joined **656**.

除此之外，[Taro 交流社区](https://taro-club.jd.com/) 发帖数也达到 **3000** 个，每周以 **200** 个左右的增速在增加，而 [Taro 官方文档](https://docs.taro.zone/) 作为 Taro 入门及开发必备的资源，每周的访问量达到了 **20w**。

And Taro has **20 out of** **500** about developers exchange microcredits, and 10 more discussion groups with small team members, large company R&D teams, and Taro team developers are subjected to massive information bombing every day.

Thus, Taro currently has a large and active developer community that generates a large amount of information on a daily basis, either as a problem, as a recommendation, as a code submission or as a useful wheel.When communities become larger, how to manage effectively and improve their overall experience of use becomes a problem for the Taro team, and there is an urgent need to find a balance between programme iterations and community maintenance, so that Taro can go further and develop better.

## Community Power

What is known as Single Wire Unlined, Wooden Not Forest.

Taro has been developed away from projects that belong to a single team, but rather from the whole Taro development community.在 Taro 所属的 NervJS 组织的[成员](https://github.com/orgs/NervJS/people)中也已经加入了像华为、腾讯等其他公司的研发人员，共同建设项目，而整个社区的贡献者也达到了 **230** 位。

而在所有的社区贡献中，需要特别感谢：

-  [Tom Huang](https://github.com/nanjingboy/) to develop MobX support on all ends independently for Taro
-  [jsNewbee](https://github.com/js-newbee/), gives Taro a full version of[multi-end examples that support the applet + H5 + React Native](https://github.com/qit-team/taro-yanxuan)
-  [Chunlin](https://github.com/Qiyu8/)from Huawe. Finished with fast app conversion support for Taro

Thanks are also due to the [TaroUI](https://github.com/NervJS/taro-ui) core maintainer  [Garfield5550](https://github.com/Garfield550) (Ms. ),[sound](https://github.com/yinLiangDream)and[ShaoQian Liu](https://github.com/lsqy)who will support follow-up iterations and maintenance from TaroUI.

There are, of course, [zacksleo](https://github.com/zacksleo) ,[Jay Fong](https://github.com/fjc0k),[loveonelong](https://github.com/loveonelong),[lolipop99](https://github.com/lolipop99),[waves of cake](https://github.com/bozaigao),[original crime](https://github.com/fwh1990),[loo](https://github.com/lentoo/) ,[white summer public](https://taro-club.jd.com/user/%E7%99%BD%E9%A2%86%E5%A4%8F%E5%85%AC%E5%AD%90)  , YuanQuan, tourze, lingxiaoZhu etc.

In addition, thanks to the research and development team that has been silent in providing valuable advice for Taro development：Teach Cloud, Digital Guangdong, Tencent CDC, easy web selection, China as an open source team, consumer finance, etc.

Community power has been moving forward by Taro.

So we hope that the community maintenance problems faced by Taro can be left to the community for self-management.

## Waiting you to join

In order to make the community more efficient and healthy, the Taro official team hopes to be able to attract developers from the community for joint maintenance and community building.

The Taro team will establish a threshold and incentive mechanism for each of the three types of roles to be opened up by the community to ensure overall quality.

## Write in the last

Taro is still in the early stages of development as a multi-end development solution and is a developing programme that in the near future we will have more functionality, more identity to developers, and possibly even subversive things that will make Taro a better one.Taro has topped a development peak, but he is moving toward a higher peak.

Longwind waves sometimes carry cloud sails to the oceans.
